# wordpress-intro
A becode project

WordPress today! Of course, I have heard about it but, I always think it isn't for "real" webdevelopers.
There are a lot of websites made this way and a lot of jobs looking for people who have experience in this
field as well so it might be worth checking out. This is why Becode gave us this assignment to gain some
experience with it.

For now, I will use one of their templates and see what we can achieve with it.
Last couple of years I played a lot of great games on pc and thought it would be fun to share a couple
of my favourites on this WordPress website.

Goals of this assignment would be:

* Register a wordpress domain
* Use templates to get started
* Make visual adaptations to a wordpress website
* Use a few of the wordpress features
* Add blocks to your website
* Add a Wordpress contact form
* Inject code to your Wordpress site
* Customise fonts for Wordpress websites


Once I have something to show and is up and running I will gladly post my link to the website here below:

Ok, so this is what I created so far.
Not a big fan after using WordPress for a short while, think it's too restrictive.
The fun is programming is entire freedom it gives you, now your possibilities are pretty limited.
I do see the value if you want something very, very fast. Otherwise, I believe it's more fun to design the
site yourself. This way you avoid the fact that your website looks like a lot of others.
Too generic in a sense, that's my take on it for now.
